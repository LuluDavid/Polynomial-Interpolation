# Polynomial_Interpolation

This git repository is a small implementation of polynomials and their use for interpolation.

- First of all, we define polynomials as lists of coefficients, and a few useful functions on them.
- Then, we define Lagrange interpolation for a given function.
- Then, we define Hermite interpolation for a given function.
- We also define Lagrange interpolation via Tchebychev points, in order to minimize the error between
  the interpolation Lagrange polynomial and the function it interpolates.
- Then, we introduce power series and cubic splines to approximate functions (and integrals)
- Finally, we compare all those approaches with calculus on trivial functions (exp, sin, etc.)

This repo also contains a few attempts on those objects, such as 2D interpolation of colors on a picture.
